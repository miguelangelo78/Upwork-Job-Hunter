I need a program which can take at least 20,000 lines of PL/SQL code and return a list of tables and views used in the SQL statements. The input could be a SAAS where I copy and paste the code and it returns the list of tables. Alternatively, it could be a java, c#, python, etc library which performs the same task. In the end, I am going to develop documentation, so analysts know which PL/SQL procedures use which tables. If the freelancer can provide a script which can also identify inserts, updates and deletes, that would be ideal but not a requirement. I know this challenge could be addressed with Regular Expressions, however I don't want this to be a coding job. I want to used previously developed code.

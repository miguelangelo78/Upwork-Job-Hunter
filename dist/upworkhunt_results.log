I need a program which can take at least 20,000 lines of PL/SQL code and return a list of tables and views used in the SQL statements. The input could be a SAAS where I copy and paste the code and it returns the list of tables. Alternatively, it could be a java, c#, python, etc library which performs the same task. In the end, I am going to develop documentation, so analysts know which PL/SQL procedures use which tables. If the freelancer can provide a script which can also identify inserts, updates and deletes, that would be ideal but not a requirement. I know this challenge could be addressed with Regular Expressions, however I don't want this to be a coding job. I want to used previously developed code.

- Job title: Need Quick Turnaround - Simple Data Visualization
- Description: I have a web platform which allows users to visually connect media clips together via drag & drop canvas. You click one media file and the click the 2nd file and a dynamic, directional line is created connecting them. However the javascript library (Raphael.js) we are using is antiquated and starts to break up after several connections are made or if a connected clip is moved they may all start to move. Please see the attached image I need a new library integrated, or code developed, that replicates the original planned behavior but is more reliable and does not break up. I think D3.js is likely a solution but am open to other suggestions. Am ready to get this started immediately, ie. today. Please send examples of similar/data visualization work. Thank you

- Description: SuiteCRM comes with a default contracts module that's intended for contract pricing based on products and sales targets for said contract. Unfortunately that is not overly useful to us. We merge AKA ETL our CRM information back into our ERP system and there's no sense in changing our business logic as it works. We offer specialized pricing to our customers based on previously negotiated agreement. We need a Module that can support our business logic and represent that in CRM correctly. Part of that business logic offers pricing in three forms. Fixed pricing for a product, percentage discount for a product (both of these SuiteCRM can do - somewhat) and the third most important. Category Discount for an entire range of products- This seems to be the one thing that SuiteCRM seemed to miss with the module. The module MUST use the existing products and categories module from SuiteCRM and can be an extention / mod of the existing Contracts module or it can be new and clean. Additionally,...
